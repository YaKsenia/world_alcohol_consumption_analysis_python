# World alcohol consumption analysis with Python

The project in Python for analyzing World bank data about alcohol consumption in different countries in 1980-2016. 

Firstly, the project gives you an overview of the data in general (changes through all years). 

Secondly, you can choose any two years in range 1980-2016, which you would like to compare with each other, see visualization of alcohol consumption in these periods in comparison next to each other and run hypothesis statistical tests to prove if these was a significant change in alcohol consumption between these two years or not.

Before running the project, you have to install the necessary software typing this command in your Terminal/command line:

**python3.6 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade**
